**Performance-Based Budgeting**
------------------------
### What Is Performance-Based Budgeting?

Performance-based budgeting is the allocation of funds based on programmatic results that contribute to organizational goals. For governments, performance-based budgeting uses evidence to maximize the allocation of funds toward programs that work and away from those that don’t. Performance-based budgeting is not intended to punish or reward departments or agencies, but instead to focus on progress toward measurable goals during the budget process. This approach allows cities to make and justify budgetary changes that meet community needs and advance citywide priorities, instead of defaulting to the status quo.

After hearing the call for a new way to budget, Johns Hopkins University Center for Government Excellence has created this guide, detailing performance-based budgeting and describing how it can be tied into new or existing performance management and analytics programs. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following the steps described in this guide, cities will have a greater understanding of performance-based budgeting and be well on their way to rethinking how budgeting can work for them.

<hr>
Terminology

What GovEx refers to as performance-based budgeting is known by a variety of names: outcome-based budgeting, results-based budgeting, or priority-based budgeting. All of these terms indicate a focus on increasing the use of data and evidence to improve the allocation of resources and achieve programmatic and community goals. This guide uses performance-based budgeting for the sake of clarity and consistency.
<hr>

Performance-based budgeting allows cities to strengthen the budgetary process in light of competing claims for resources by using objective criteria to:

* determine resource allocation;
* ensure accountability among those responsible for management;
* shift the budget focus to city priorities rather than department- or agency-specific goals;
* make the budget process more transparent; and
* engage the community in the budgeting process.

Especially in times of fiscal constraint, performance-based budgeting helps cities focus on funding programs that advance progress on the determined goals and priorities.

Cities with established performance management systems are well-positioned to take on performance-based budgeting. Cities can incorporate performance budgeting into existing performance management programs, linking budgetary requests to their publicly stated performance goals to truly align resources with results. The guidelines below are not meant to replace a city’s budget process, but are proposed as components that can be integrated into the budget process to more closely align budgeting with city priorities and goals.

### Principles for Implementation

Implementing performance-based budgeting is a process that requires clearly defined city priorities and goals, an understanding of performance measurement, and dedicated staff and city resources. Most importantly, implementation takes time, and cities should expect to spend at least one budget cycle preparing for the implementation of performance-based budgeting. Executive leadership commitment is critical; as with many city projects, performance-based budgeting will not succeed without it. Having an executive leader involved in the process signals to the rest of the organization that performance-based budgeting is the way the city is approaching budgeting, frequently alleviating buy-in and culture change concerns and unifying elected officials, senior leadership, and city staff around budget goals.

The principles listed below are designed to help cities think through key issues as they launch performance-based budgeting initiatives. Each principle includes an example from a city that is currently doing performance-based budgeting. These examples are simple ways to conceptualize the principles, but the practical application may differ across cities due to any number of factors, including form of government, organizational structure, and staff capacity and involvement.

**_1. Determine a method for aligning performance-based budgeting with the current budget cycle and process and think about messaging the changes internally early in the process._**

Since cities already have budget processes that have been in place for decades, ensuring that the transition to performance-based budgeting is as logistically seamless as possible is important for successful adoption and implementation. Aligning the new process with existing schedules and procedures can make it easier for employees to adjust to performance-based budgeting. This also helps ensure that employees focus on progress toward goals--the crux of performance-based budgeting--rather than logistical changes.

In 2011, Baltimore, MD, was very clear in messaging the move to [performance-based budgeting](http://bbmr.baltimorecity.gov/OutcomeBudgeting.aspx) to city staff and officials and aligning this process to its previous budgeting schedule. This required [reframing the budget conversation](http://www.aabpa.org/assets/Symposia/2014_Summer_Symposium_July10-2014/kleine_outcome%20budgeting%20in%20baltimore%20aabpa%207.10.14.pdf) from considering last year’s spending on agency goals and debating what to cut to focusing on next year’s strategic goals for citywide priorities and debating what is worth keeping in the budget. In Baltimore, performance-based budgeting is connected to its CitiStat program, strategic plan, and agency performance agreements and aligns with the city’s goal of being a performance-based city so it seemed like a natural addition to city staff.

Providing timelines and coaching to explain how performance management fits in with the existing budget process is the first step to ensuring that departments and agencies understand and use performance-based budgeting effectively. Baltimore, like many cities, has historically had a long and detailed process for developing and submitting agency budgets, beginning in September and lasting through July when the budget is adopted. To make it easier for agencies to align their budget requests with the performance-based budgeting and performance metrics, Baltimore’s budget office includes step-by-step guidance for agencies detailing the mayor’s priority outcomes (see Appendix A for examples of citywide priorities in performance-based budgeting), informed by the [annual citizen survey](http://bbmr.baltimorecity.gov/OutcomeBudgeting/CitizenSurvey.aspx), and indicators of emphasis for the fiscal year budget process. By clearly defining the [budgeting expectations and process](http://www.businessofgovernment.org/blog/business-government/baltimores-outcome-budgeting-approach) up front, the city ensured staff participation and buy-in, reconciling a [$500 million budget deficit](http://results4america.org/city-baltimore-use-evidence-data-fact-sheet/) in four fiscal years.

**_2. Develop guidelines for department or agency budget proposals that include guidance on choosing goals, metrics, and strategies from the city’s existing strategic framework._**

If a city is already using performance management, there is probably a strategic framework that organizes priorities, breaks them down into goals, and uses metrics to track progress. The city may even be using a prevailing measure known as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for its priority areas. Cities may use this strategic framework to develop guidelines for budget proposals, requiring that proposals include references to existing priorities and show anticipated progress towards goals based on existing metrics and KPIs.
Chattanooga, TN, uses its performance management initiative, [ChattaData](https://performance.chattanooga.gov/), as a strategic framework for its performance-based budgeting program. In 2016, Chattanooga held training sessions for city staff and nonprofits interested in learning about the city’s performance-based budgeting process. There were five sessions:

1. How performance-based budgeting relates to ChattaData
2. How to set a goal that aligns to the five citywide priorities
3. What a good performance metric looks like
4. How to go about setting a target
5. What’s the key to bringing all these components together in a budget proposal.

City leaders were impressed by the number of stakeholder participants these events and participants left asking for more performance management and performance-based budgeting training sessions throughout the year. By following clear guidelines for the budgeting process and gaining a deeper understanding of how goals, metrics, and targets fit into the process, writers produce high-quality proposals, lessen the time it takes to evaluate these proposals, and feel in control of and involved in the budgeting process.

<p align="center"> <strong> Example of ChattaData Goal Taxonomy from Budgeting Training </strong> </p>

<table>
<tr align=center><td>Citywide Priority <br /> Safer Streets </td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>Citywide Goal <br /> Reduce Violent Crime by 20% by June 30, 2016</td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>Citywide Key Performance Indicator (KPI) <br /> Average Monthly Violent Crime Incidents</td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>Fire Department’s Budget Proposal Desired Outcome <br /> Reduce violent crimes; Reduce juvenile crimes</td></tr>
<tr align=center><td>Fire Department’s Budget Proposal Description of Output Measured <br /> Evaluation of fire investigation activities and arson conviction rate to ensure measures receive due attention; if high conviction rate changes, data can help determine course of action to correct; also to ensure juvenile arson numbers remain low</td></tr>
</table>

*See Appendix B for an example of how Baltimore, Lincoln, and Richmond align their priorities, goals, and key performance indicators.*

Chattanooga has also published clear guidelines for department and nonprofit budget proposals on its [performance-based budgeting website](http://connect.chattanooga.gov/bfo/). The website defines the budgeting process and walks proposal writers through the [proposal requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBiNj1AJ6uhqiVbr2T8ZH-qZgVQFRIPedADxsMLW4vc/pub), which include aligning the proposal to one of the city’s priorities, listing supporting performance metrics and targets, and discussing strategies to reach the expected outcome of this budget proposal. The city even links to [sample proposals](http://www.chattanooga.gov/finance/finance-division/2016-bfo-offers) from [city staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kK9-V6-toPGPeQLjn9xP5wqJXy78hbHbbFju_kygH-A/edit) and [nonprofits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2vMJCmtP1cbYVVWU0JsMFl4eG8/view) in the community to demonstrate exactly what it is looking for. *See Appendix D for more information on how Chattanooga incorporates nonprofits into its performance-based budgeting process.*

**_3. Identify an objective interdisciplinary team to evaluate budget requests and proposals and make recommendations based on current fiscal year overview._**

For each priority, cities should consider who will review and evaluate the proposals and make recommendations for funding to the mayor, city manager, or senior leadership. The team is often an interdepartmental group of leaders, but may also include executive and central administration staff or even community members. The team will be charged with scoring and ranking budget proposals that will advance progress on these citywide goals. They may also be responsible for working through the performance-based budgeting process with proposal writers, providing feedback and guidance along the way. Usually, the team will evaluate proposals based on KPIs, guidelines, and criteria distributed to departments in preparation for budget proposals, as described above.

Bellevue, WA, uses Results Teams to evaluate proposals through its performance-based budget program, [Budget One](http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/budgets.htm). There is one team for each priority area that is charged with evaluating budget proposals, working with proposal writers to improve their proposals, and providing funding recommendations to the city’s Leadership Team. The city manager selects Results Team members and being chosen is seen as an honor. Members come from different departments and levels of the organization (from professional staff and frontline workers to managers), bringing unique mindsets to the evaluation process. While all Results Team members are city staff, they are conscious about evaluating proposals from a community and resident perspective. For more information about Bellevue’s Results Teams and their role in performance-based budgeting, see pages 5-4–5-6 in the city’s [2015–2016 Budget and 2015–2021 Capital Investment Program Plan](http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/pdf/Finance/2015%202016%20Adopted%20Budget%20Book%20Final.pdf).

Bellevue is in the process of revamping its scoring criteria for budget proposals to further encourage collaboration between Results Teams and proposal writers by providing multiple occasions to discuss and revise the proposals, while also elevating the quality of the performance metrics supporting these proposals. During this budget cycle, Results Teams will score both the performance metrics and proposal as a whole with a high-medium-low scale. Proposals must meet a minimum score on their performance metrics before being recommended for funding.

<table>
<tr align=center><td><strong> Bellevue’s Performance Metric Scoring </strong></td></tr>
<tr align=center><td> Are the metrics well-rounded and comprehensive (a family of measures)? <br /> Are the metrics actionable (departments can impact or influence these metrics)? <br /> Are the metrics outcome-oriented? <br /> Is the data source identified and reliable? <br /> Is the data updated with the appropriate frequency for decision making? <br /> Are the metrics’ targets aspirational and also realistic? </td></tr>
</table>

*See Appendix C for performance-based budgeting scoring criteria from Baltimore and Chattanooga.*

**_4. Use an executive group to reconcile budget proposals._**

Departments and agencies are responsible for preparing budget proposals that are responsive to the goals, strategies, and criteria discussed above. In some cases, multiple groups may submit proposals in support of one goal and one group may submit proposals in support of multiple goals. The shift in focus from departments to citywide goals and programs shifts the focus away from department-driven decision making and enables departments to frame their decisions in terms of community goals. Usually, the mayor’s office, city manager’s office, or the central budget department is responsible for aligning budget requests and proposals to ensure that efforts to accomplish citywide goals are coordinated.

Notably, some cities expand the focus on coordinating priorities to include nonprofits applying for city funding and requiring these organizations to submit budget requests in alignment with citywide goals. This helps ensure that all entities participating in the budget process are focusing on citywide goals. *See Appendix D for more information on how Chattanooga incorporates nonprofits into its performance-based budgeting process.*

Richmond, VA, relies on the city’s budget staff, chief administrative officer,
mayor, and city council to review submitted budget requests for its [performance-based budgeting program](http://www.richmondgov.com/budget/index.aspx). After the citywide budget proposal evaluation teams have reviewed and evaluated budget proposals, they hold working sessions with the mayor to discuss issues and concerns in making funding decisions for both the operating and capital budgets. Once the mayor has a deep understanding of the budget proposals and how they align with each other and Richmond’s citywide priorities, the budget is presented to city council for additional review and coordination of proposals. Finally, public hearings are held before the budget is adopted so the community can give input on the budget proposals. See sections 3 and 4 of Richmond’s [Adopted Biennial Fiscal Plans for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 & Adopted Capital Improvement Program for Fiscal Years 2014–2018](http://www.richmondgov.com/budget/documents/BiennialPlans/2014-15_AdoptedBiennialAndCIP_FY14-FY18.pdf).

**_5. Monitor the budget through a defined performance framework._**

Between budget cycles, cities should monitor progress on the KPIs and metrics for each goal and priority area. Tracking progress by goal area through the city performance management system allows for easy comparison across departments and agencies and helps to drive cooperation and focus on citywide goals. Tracking in this manner also integrates the work of performance-based budgeting into the work of departments throughout the year. Year-round goal and metric monitoring helps embed the work of budgeting as a regular practice instead of an annual exercise separate from “real” work. It can be beneficial to encourage collaboration between the budget and performance teams (if they are separate in your government) during this process to ensure there is a deep understanding of their joint efforts and coordination of their roles and responsibilities.

Cities across the country use a variety of methods (performance management programs, stat meetings, balanced budget scorecards, and executive leadership meetings) to monitor budget allocations and ensure that departments and agencies are making progress toward their desired outcomes.

Lincoln, NE, tracks its budget allocations in executive leadership meetings and [community stakeholder events](http://www.gfoa.org/sites/default/files/GFR_JUN_14_18.pdf) during the year through its [Taking Charge](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/mayor/takingcharge/how-it-works.htm) initiative. Additionally, the city monitors funding allocations, [program and service delivery prioritization](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/mayor/takingcharge/program-prioritization.htm) information, and [Taking Charge changes](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/mayor/takingcharge/changes.htm) on its website, providing insight into why these decisions were made. City staff and residents alike are able to engage with this information, increasing trust in government in Lincoln and creating a unified vision for the city’s performance-based budgeting process.

### Conclusion

Performance management is a natural precursor to performance-based budgeting. The focus on using data and evidence to understand which programs and initiatives are furthering progress towards goals should lead an organization to think about which programs and initiatives should be funded. Many cities are building on existing performance management efforts to expand into performance-based budgeting. By thinking strategically about how performance-based budgeting aligns to current budgeting efforts, developing clear guidelines for proposals and the revised budgeting process, and building in opportunities for revisioning and monitoring, cities can dramatically shift their budgeting conversations from what should be cut to what should be kept, while building consensus internally and externally for those decisions.

### Appendix B - Key Priority Indicators (KPIs)

<hr>

Baltimore, MD, has identified Safer Streets, which makes up 33% of Baltimore City’s $2.549 billion operating budget, as a priority outcome, with six key strategies that support the priority outcome. The strategies outline diverse agency actions such as code enforcement, zoning classification, outreach to at-risk youth, etc. Five goals support the priority outcome, and each goal is accompanied by a KPI. The KPIs may not be representative of all activities for which an agency is responsible.

| Priority Goal | Agency | KPI | YTD Data (FY 2013) | Previous Year (FY 2012) | Goal/ Benchmark |

About this measure:
This measure indicates the rate of self-reported smoking in samples of students in grades 9-12 voluntarily participating in the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS). LLCHD conducts the YRBS every other year in Lincoln and Lancaster County high schools; the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services conducts the YRBS every other year in high schools across the state.

Why this is important:
More than 80% of adult smokers began smoking before 18 years of age. Every year 2,000 youth in Nebraska under age 18 become new daily smokers. If current smoking trends continue, 36,000 children and youth now alive in Nebraska will likely die prematurely from smoking related illnesses. Preventing youth from starting to use tobacco is far more effective than helping them break the addictive behavior.

What is being done:
Youth continue to experiment with tobacco in succumbing to peer-pressure, tobacco advertising, and emulating negative behavior of adult role models. LLCHD, TFLC, City departments and community partners strive to prevent initiation of tobacco use and reduce current rates of youth tobacco use by:

* Monitoring retailer compliance of illegal sales of tobacco products to minors
* Educating youth on the dangerous consequences of tobacco use
* Educating youth on the impact of tobacco advertising
* Assist youth sports organizations in establishing tobacco-free policies
* Promote tobacco free environments
* Utilizing peer support to prevent tobacco initiation
