Performance-based budgeting is the allocation of funds based on programmatic results that contribute to organizational goals. For governments, performance-based budgeting uses evidence to maximize the allocation of funds toward programs that work and away from those that donâ€™t. This guide details performance-based budgeting and describes how it can be tied into new or existing performance management and analytics programs. 


To assist cities in developing performance-based budgeting practices, the [Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University](http://govex.jhu.edu/), a partner in the [What Works Cities initiative](http://www.whatworkscities.org/), has created this guide. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following the steps described in this guide, cities will have a greater understanding of performance-based budgeting and be well on their way to rethinking how budgeting can work for them.
