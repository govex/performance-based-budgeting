### What Is Performance-Based Budgeting?

Performance-based budgeting is the allocation of funds based on programmatic results that contribute to organizational goals. For governments, performance-based budgeting uses evidence to maximize the allocation of funds toward programs that work and away from those that donâ€™t. Performance-based budgeting is not intended to punish or reward departments or agencies, but instead to focus on progress toward measurable goals during the budget process. This approach allows cities to make and justify budgetary changes that meet community needs and advance citywide priorities, instead of defaulting to the status quo.

After hearing the call for a new way to budget, Johns Hopkins University Center for Government Excellence has created this guide, detailing performance-based budgeting and describing how it can be tied into new or existing performance management and analytics programs. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following the steps described in this guide, cities will have a greater understanding of performance-based budgeting and be well on their way to rethinking how budgeting can work for them.
